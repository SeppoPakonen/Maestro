I'll help you create comprehensive tests for the Maestro CLI4 settings and configuration system. Let me start by creating a todo list to track all the required tasks.

I'll start by creating the required test files. Let me begin with the package initialization files and then create the test files as specified.

I've completed all the required tasks for implementing comprehensive tests for the Maestro CLI4 settings and configuration system:

1. Created `tests/config/__init__.py` - Package initialization for config tests
2. Created `tests/config/test_settings.py` - Comprehensive tests for the Settings module
3. Created `tests/commands/__init__.py` - Package initialization for commands tests
4. Created `tests/commands/test_settings_command.py` - Tests for the settings command functionality
5. Created `tests/commands/test_context_command.py` - Tests for context management commands
6. Created `cli4_task4_summary.txt` - Summary of test coverage

All tests follow pytest best practices with proper setup/teardown methods, use temporary directories for isolation, and include both success and failure scenario testing. The tests cover all aspects of the settings and configuration system including creation, loading, saving, validation, dot notation access, section operations, and command-line interfaces.
