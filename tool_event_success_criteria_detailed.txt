I'll create a detailed success criteria document for tool event capture as part of Task aicli4-1. Let me first check the existing documentation to understand the context.

Now let me check the test plan document to understand the requirements better:

Now I'll create the detailed success criteria document for tool event capture as part of Task aicli4-1. Let me create this document:

I've created a comprehensive document outlining the detailed success criteria for tool event capture as part of Task aicli4-1. The document includes specific, measurable criteria organized into four main sections:

1. **Message Types Validation** - Ensures all tool event types (request, response, status, confirmation) contain required fields with correct formatting
2. **Content Accuracy Requirements** - Validates that captured content matches source content and maintains proper data types and encoding
3. **Timing Requirements** - Defines acceptable latency, timestamp precision, and sequential consistency standards
4. **Correlation Validation** - Ensures proper linking between related events, session consistency, and multi-component correlation

The document also includes additional sections for performance benchmarks, error resilience, conformance verification, and validation methodology to provide a complete framework for testing the tool event capture functionality.

The criteria are specific and testable, focusing on measurable outcomes that can be validated through automated and manual testing approaches.
