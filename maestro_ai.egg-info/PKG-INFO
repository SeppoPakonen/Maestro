# **README.md — Maestro**

### *AI–Driven Project Composition & Branching Workflow Conductor*

Maestro is a command-line tool for composing complex projects with multiple AI models.
Rather than pushing tasks through a linear pipeline, Maestro behaves like a *conductor* guiding an orchestra of models — planners, workers, refiners — each an instrument with its own voice.

A project planned with Maestro grows organically, like a living composition:
themes develop, branches emerge, variations unfold, and motifs resolve across multiple voices.

Maestro helps humans and AIs work together to **shape, refine, and restructure** ambitious ideas — one movement at a time.

---

## Features

### **1. Conversational Planning (The Opening Movement)**

Plans don't appear fully formed  they are *composed*.
Maestro lets you **talk** with its planning AIs (Codex or Claude):

* Discuss, revise, and sculpt the plan
* Rewrite or clean" the root task
* Break the project into subtasks
* Control how much of the root task is given to each worker

You can conduct this process in two modes:

* **Interactive planning** (`--discuss-plan`)
  Talk with the AI until the structure feels right.

* **One-shot planning** (`--one-shot-plan`)
  Produce a clean JSON plan in a single gesture.

If neither mode is specified, Maestro politely asks which style you prefer.

---

### **2. Branching Plans (Fugues, Variations, and Development)**

Real projects don't move in straight lines — they branch.
Maestro treats planning as a **tree of musical ideas**:

* Every plan is a *motif*: a node in a branching structure
* You can create new branches mid-project
* Old branches remain as "dead ends" or alternative interpretations
* You can freely switch focus between branches
* A plan tree can be printed as colored ASCII score-like structure:

```
[*] P1  Main Theme (active)
 ├─ P2  Variant: Split Backend
 │    └─ P3  Variant: Minimal API (dead)
 └ P4  Variant: Test-Driven Rewrite
```

Each branch represents a different interpretation of your original composition.

---

### **3. Multi-Engine Orchestration (Your Orchestra of AIs)**

Maestro assigns roles according to each model's strengths:

**Planners**

* **Codex** – architectural motifs, structural design, advanced debugging
* **Claude** – deep reasoning, complex refinement, expressive thought

**Workers**

* **Qwen** – implementation, coding, straightforward bugfixing
* **Gemini** – natural-language heavy tasks, research, summarization

Each subtask receives a carefully crafted prompt with:

* cleaned root task excerpt
* relevant categories (like instrumental sections)
* context from previous movements
* optional partial outputs from interrupted runs

---

### **4. Intelligent Root Task Handling (From Sketch to Score)**

Instead of shoving the raw root task into every prompt, Maestro:

* rewrites your root task into a **clean, musical score**
* extracts conceptual **categories** (sections, voices, instruments)
* assigns only the relevant sections to each subtask
* optionally produces excerpts for workers

This keeps prompts focused, reducing noise and creative drift.

---

### **5. Graceful Interrupts (The Pause Between Movements)**

If you press **Ctrl+C**, Maestro behaves like a seasoned conductor:

* Stops the current AI subprocess gently
* Captures all partial output
* Saves it as part of the project history
* Marks the subtask as *interrupted*
* Allows a later continuation, including partial context in the next prompt

No stack traces. No lost work. No broken flow.

---

### **6. Rich Session State & Continuity (The Concert Archive)**

Maestro stores:

* root task raw + cleaned version
* categories + excerpts
* plan tree nodes
* subtask statuses
* all input prompts
* all raw AI outputs
* partial results
* user-facing summaries

Maestro ensures that every run is reproducible — every rehearsal preserved.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/maestro.git
cd maestro
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or editable install:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

---

## Usage

### Create a new session:

```bash
echo "Build a MIDI-driven sandbox game engine" \
  | maestro --session sessions/game.json --new
```

### Start planning:

```bash
maestro --session sessions/game.json --plan
```

(defaults to interactive discussion)

### Or produce a plan in one gesture:

```bash
maestro -s sessions/game.json --one-shot-plan
```

### Resume execution:

```bash
maestro -s sessions/game.json --resume
```

### Show the branching plan tree:

```bash
maestro -s sessions/game.json --show-plan-tree
```

### Shift the conductor's focus:

```bash
maestro -s sessions/game.json --focus-plan P4
```

## Philosophy

> *To compose is to discover.*
> And discovery is rarely linear.

Maestro assumes:

* Creativity grows through branching ideas
* Plans evolve like musical themes  explored, revisited, refined
* AI is best used as a collaborative instrument, not a silent worker
* Human intuition guides the music; AI provides the ensemble
* Every project is a symphony in progress

Maestro exists to ensure your composition — technical or artistic — can unfold freely, gracefully, and intelligently.
