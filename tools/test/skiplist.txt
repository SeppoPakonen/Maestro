# Skiplist for Maestro test runner (opt-in mode)
# Each line is a pattern passed to pytest --ignore
# Blank lines and lines starting with # are ignored
#
# POLICY: This skiplist is now OPT-IN only.
# Default test runs do NOT use this file.
# Use --skiplist tools/test/skiplist.txt to enable skipping.
#
# The portable test subset is defined by:
# 1. conftest.py pytest_ignore_collect hook (excludes legacy/ and deleted files)
# 2. pytest.ini -m "not legacy and not slow" (excludes legacy and slow markers)
#
# Status: All previously-skipped tests have been:
# - FIXED and enabled (test_parse_todo_md_empty, test_repo_keyword_shows_help, etc.)
# - Marked @pytest.mark.slow (ai_upp tests, async work tests)
# - Documented in test backlog (work gates blocker tests)
#
# See: docs/workflows/v3/reports/skiplist_burndown.md
# See: docs/workflows/v3/reports/test_backlog_from_skiplist.md

# Tests expecting unimplemented features (documented in test_backlog_from_skiplist.md)
# These remain in skiplist until features are implemented
