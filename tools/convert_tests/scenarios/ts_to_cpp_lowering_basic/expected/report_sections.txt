# Conversion Report for TypeScript to C++ Lowering

## Conversion Summary
- Intent: high_to_low_level
- Source: TypeScript with async/await, interfaces, type system
- Target: C++ with manual memory management, static typing, async patterns

## Semantic Losses Identified
- TypeScript's compile-time type system (not runtime)
- Async/await patterns converted to futures or callbacks
- Interface definitions without direct C++ equivalent
- Module system differences
- Optional chaining replaced with explicit checks

## Conversion Quality Metrics
- File equivalence: Low to medium (expected for high_to_low conversion)
- Concept preservation: Medium (core logic preserved, but type safety changed)
- Loss ledger: Non-empty as expected for lowering conversion

## Verification Results
- Test vectors execution: Should work with C++ equivalent implementations
- Build status: Not required (verification_mode: vectors_only)
- Semantic diff: Shows expected losses and approximations

## Risk Assessment
- Type safety differences between compile-time systems
- Async/await to C++ async patterns may have complexity
- Memory management patterns differ
- Error handling patterns change from exceptions to error codes
