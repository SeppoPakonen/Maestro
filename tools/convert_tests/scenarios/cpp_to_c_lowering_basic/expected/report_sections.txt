# Conversion Report for C++ to C Lowering

## Conversion Summary
- Intent: high_to_low_level
- Source: C++ with classes, RAII, smart pointers, STL containers
- Target: C with manual memory management, function-based design

## Semantic Losses Identified
- Classes converted to structs with function pointers
- RAII destructors replaced with manual cleanup functions
- Smart pointers replaced with raw pointers and manual memory management
- STL containers replaced with raw arrays/dynamic allocation
- Exception handling replaced with error codes

## Conversion Quality Metrics
- File equivalence: Low to medium (expected for high_to_low conversion)
- Concept preservation: Medium (core logic preserved, but idioms changed)
- Loss ledger: Non-empty as expected for lowering conversion

## Verification Results
- Test vectors execution: Should work with C equivalent implementations
- Build status: Not required (verification_mode: vectors_only)
- Semantic diff: Shows expected losses and approximations

## Risk Assessment
- Requires manual memory management
- Error handling pattern changes
- Performance characteristics may differ
