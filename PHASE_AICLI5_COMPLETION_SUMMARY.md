- Analyzed input injection entry points for all agents
- Compared protocol requirements with current payload structures
- Identified transport differences across agents
- Documented tool event granularity gaps
- Identified candidates for shared helpers across agents
- Created comprehensive documentation to guide future implementation

## Next Steps

With Phase aicli5 completed, the next phases in the track are:
