I'll help you create detailed success criteria for tool event capture based on the existing LIVE_TOOL_EVENTS_INPUT_INJECTION_TEST_PLAN.md file. First, let me locate and examine that file to understand the current test plan structure.

Now I'll search for any other relevant files that might provide additional context about the AI CLI Live Tool Protocol or tool event capture.

Let me look at the AI CLI Live Tool Protocol specification to better understand the message types and event structure.

Now let me look at the current protocol implementation summary to get more context:

Now I'll look at the message types and emission points document to further understand how events should be captured:

Let me also look at the agent hooks documentation to understand where the events should be captured:

Now I'll look at the phases documents to understand the specific task requirements for Task aicli4-1:

Now I'll create the detailed success criteria for tool event capture as part of Task aicli4-1. Let me start by creating a structured document for this:

I'll now create detailed success criteria for tool event capture as part of Task aicli4-1. Let me work on defining success criteria for message types validation first.

Now I'll define success criteria for content accuracy.

Next, I'll define success criteria for timing aspects of tool event capture.

Now I'll define success criteria for correlation aspects of tool event capture.

Finally, I'll document the complete success criteria in the proper format.

Now I'll create the detailed success criteria document for tool event capture as part of Task aicli4-1:

Perfect! I've created a comprehensive document outlining the success criteria for tool event capture as part of Task aicli4-1: Protocol Test Plan. The document addresses all the requirements specified by the user, defining what constitutes successful tool event capture in terms of:

1. Message types validation - ensuring all required message types are emitted correctly
2. Content accuracy - verifying all required fields are populated with correct data
3. Timing - ensuring events are emitted in the proper sequence with appropriate timestamps
4. Correlation - verifying proper matching of related events using correlation IDs

The document follows the format and terminology from the existing LIVE_TOOL_EVENTS_INPUT_INJECTION_TEST_PLAN.md file and other related documents in the Maestro project, maintaining consistency with the project's established protocols and conventions.
