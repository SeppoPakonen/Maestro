# Pytest configuration for Maestro

# Policy: Tests must align with v3 runbook CLI command surface
# See: docs/workflows/v3/reports/test_command_truth_policy.md
# Canonical commands: docs/workflows/v3/reports/allowed_commands.normalized.txt

# Register custom markers
markers =
    legacy: marks tests as legacy (deprecated code paths, skipped by default)
    pexpect: marks tests that require pexpect module (skipped if not installed)
    slow: marks tests as slow (deselected with '-m "not slow"')
    medium: marks tests as medium speed (reasonable runtime, not fast but not slow)
    fast: marks tests as fast (quick unit tests, minimal I/O)
    integration: marks tests as integration tests
    tui: marks tests that require TUI dependencies
    git: marks tests that perform git operations
    serial: tests that must run in exclusive mode (no xdist)
