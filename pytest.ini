# Policy: Tests must align with v3 runbook CLI command surface

# Canonical commands: docs/workflows/v3/reports/allowed_commands.normalized.txt

# Register custom markers
markers =

    pexpect: marks tests that require pexpect module (skipped if not installed)
    slow: marks tests as slow (deselected with '-m "not slow"')
    medium: marks tests as medium speed (reasonable runtime, not fast but not slow)
    fast: marks tests as fast (quick unit tests, minimal I/O)
    integration: marks tests as integration tests
