# Unit Test 4: AI Context Management Test
Objective: Verify AI context management and switching between different project elements

Setup:
- Remove ./tmp directory if it exists
- Create a fresh ./tmp directory in the project root
- Verify that ./tmp is listed in .gitignore (it should be already)
- The point is to use "python ../maestro.py" from the ./tmp directory

Steps:
1. From the ./tmp directory, run `python ../maestro.py init` to initialize the project
2. Create multiple tracks: "Frontend", "Backend", "DevOps"
3. Create phases and tasks within each track
4. Start a discussion with AI about the Frontend track: `python ../maestro.py discuss --track frontend`
5. Switch context to Backend track and continue discussion
6. Use breadcrumbs to navigate between contexts
7. Verify that AI remembers context when switching between tracks/phases/tasks
8. Test context switching with `python ../maestro.py context` commands
9. Verify that session context is preserved across multiple AI interactions

Expected Success Criteria:
- AI maintains appropriate context for each track/phase/task
- Context switching works smoothly without confusion
- Breadcrumbs properly track context navigation
- Session context is preserved between interactions
- No context bleeding between different project areas
