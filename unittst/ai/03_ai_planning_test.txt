# Unit Test 3: AI Planning Test
Objective: Verify AI planning capabilities with track/phase/task creation

Setup:
- Remove ./tmp directory if it exists
- Create a fresh ./tmp directory in the project root
- Verify that ./tmp is listed in .gitignore (it should be already)
- The point is to use "python ../maestro.py" from the ./tmp directory

Steps:
1. From the ./tmp directory, run `python ../maestro.py init` to initialize the project
2. Create a main track for "Website Redesign" project
3. Use AI to plan phases for the project by running `python ../maestro.py discuss` and asking AI to suggest phases
4. Based on AI's suggestions, create 4-5 phases: "Research", "Design", "Development", "Testing", "Deployment"
5. For each phase, create 2-3 tasks using AI suggestions
6. Verify that the plan is properly structured with tracks, phases, and tasks
7. Use `python ../maestro.py plan tree` to visualize the plan hierarchy
8. Mark early tasks as done and verify progress tracking

Expected Success Criteria:
- AI provides meaningful phase suggestions
- All phases and tasks are created successfully
- Plan tree shows proper hierarchy
- Progress tracking works correctly
- No errors during creation process
