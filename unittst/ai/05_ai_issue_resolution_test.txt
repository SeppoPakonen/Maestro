# Unit Test 5: AI Issue Resolution Test
Objective: Verify AI's ability to help identify, analyze, and resolve issues

Setup:
- Remove ./tmp directory if it exists
- Create a fresh ./tmp directory in the project root
- Verify that ./tmp is listed in .gitignore (it should be already)
- The point is to use "python ../maestro.py" from the ./tmp directory

Steps:
1. From the ./tmp directory, run `python ../maestro.py init` to initialize the project
2. Create a track "Bug Fixes" and a phase "Q4 Issues"
3. Create a problematic task or introduce an error in code
4. Use `python ../maestro.py issues add "Login authentication fails"` to register the issue
5. Run `python ../maestro.py issues analyze <issue-id>` to have AI analyze the problem
6. Use `python ../maestro.py discuss` to brainstorm solutions with AI
7. Add solutions using `python ../maestro.py solutions add` based on AI suggestions
8. Implement the fix using `python ../maestro.py work` on the related task
9. Verify the issue is resolved with `python ../maestro.py issues state <issue-id> closed`

Expected Success Criteria:
- AI correctly identifies the issue from context
- Analysis provides meaningful insights
- Solutions are practical and implementable
- Fix implementation works as expected
- Issue status updates correctly
- No regression in other functionality
