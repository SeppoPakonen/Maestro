# Unit Test 1: Init-test
Objective: Verify basic maestro initialization and track/phase/task creation

Setup:
- Remove ./tmp directory if it exists
- Create a fresh ./tmp directory in the project root
- Verify that ./tmp is listed in .gitignore (it should be already)
- The point is to use "python ../maestro.py" from the ./tmp directory

Improvement Requirement:
The `--help` command for track and phase should show complete command structure for creating entities.
Currently: `python ../maestro.py track --help` shows limited info, but `python ../maestro.py track` (without --help) shows the full usage.
The same applies to phase commands.
This should be improved so users can discover how to create tracks/phases via help commands.

Steps:
1. From the ./tmp directory, run `python ../maestro.py init` to initialize the project
2. From the ./tmp directory, use `python ../maestro.py` to add tracks, phases and tasks to create a simple CLI program for scientific calculation
3. Verify that the commands work correctly
4. Check that track/phase/task lists display the created items using `python ../maestro.py` commands
5. Mark the created tracks, phases and tasks as done using `python ../maestro.py` commands

Expected Success Criteria:
- All commands execute without errors
- Track/phase/task lists show the items that were created
- Tracks, phases and tasks can be marked as done successfully
