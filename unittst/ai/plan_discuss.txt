# Unit Test: Plan Discuss Test
Objective: Verify plan discuss command with -p prompt argument for automated testing

Setup:
- Remove ./tmp directory if it exists
- Create a fresh ./tmp directory in the project root
- Verify that ./tmp is listed in .gitignore (it should be already)
- The point is to use "python ../maestro.py" from the ./tmp directory

Steps:
1. From the ./tmp directory, run `python ../maestro.py init` to initialize the project
2. Create a new plan for a "Minesweeper Game" using `python ../maestro.py plan add "Minesweeper Game"`
3. Add initial items to the plan:
   - "Create game board grid"
   - "Implement mine placement logic"
   - "Add click handlers"
4. Use plan discuss with -p argument to add new items: `python ../maestro.py plan discuss 1 -p "Add a new title 'Add scoring system' and bullet points for 'Track time', 'Count moves', and 'Show high scores'"`
5. Run `python ../maestro.py plan explore` to convert the plan into project operations
6. Verify that the explore command created:
   - At least 1 track
   - At least 1 phase within that track
   - At least 1 task within that phase
7. Check docs/todo.md to ensure the structure was created correctly

Expected Success Criteria:
- Plan is created successfully
- Plan discuss with -p argument adds the requested items automatically (no interactive prompts)
- Plan explore converts the plan into proper project structure
- docs/todo.md contains at least 1 track with 1 phase and 1 task
- No errors during the process
