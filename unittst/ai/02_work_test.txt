# Unit Test 2: Work-test
Objective: Verify the work feature with breadcrumbs and AI synchronization

Setup:
- Remove ./tmp directory if it exists
- Create a fresh ./tmp directory in the project root
- Verify that ./tmp is listed in .gitignore (it should be already)
- The point is to use "python ../maestro.py" from the ./tmp directory

Steps:
1. From the ./tmp directory, run `python ../maestro.py init` to initialize the project
2. From the ./tmp directory, create a track, phase and task using `python ../maestro.py`
3. Define 5 points for the task (foobar points - be creative):
   - Point A: Implement basic calculation function
   - Point B: Add input validation
   - Point C: Create output formatting
   - Point D: Add error handling
   - Point E: Optimize performance
4. After each point, verify breadcrumbs are created (as implemented in phase ws2)
5. After the 5th point, use AI to respond as JSON using `python ../maestro.py ai` command
6. Execute `python ../maestro.py work task <task-id>` to start working on the task
7. Use the appropriate command to display all breadcrumbs, responses, and AI synchronizations

Expected Success Criteria:
- Breadcrumbs are properly recorded between each point
- AI responds with JSON after the 5th point
- The command to display breadcrumbs shows all recorded breadcrumbs and responses
- AI synchronization works as expected
