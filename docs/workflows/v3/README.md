# Workflows v3

This directory contains synthesis artifacts derived from v2 runbook examples.
The focus is governance: allowed commands, gaps, contradictions, and the ledger
of required implementation work for a credible v3 CLI.

- reports/: audits, command registry, and synthesis summaries
- runbooks/: curated examples and input snapshots for traceability
- IMPLEMENTATION_LEDGER.md: proposed code changes and acceptance criteria
