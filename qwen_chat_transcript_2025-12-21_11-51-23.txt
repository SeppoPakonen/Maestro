## Standard Output:
I'll help you create a simple Python script with a function that calculates the square of a number. Let me write this for you:

I apologize for the confusion. I don't have permission to write files directly. Instead, I'll show you the content of the Python script here:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
A simple Python script that prints 'Hello, World!' and includes
a function to calculate the square of a number.
"""

def square(number):
    """
    Calculate the square of a given number.
    
    Args:
        number (int or float): The number to be squared
        
    Returns:
        int or float: The square of the input number
    """
    return number ** 2


def main():
    """Main function to demonstrate the script."""
    print("Hello, World!")
    
    # Demonstrate the square function
    num = 5
    result = square(num)
    print(f"The square of {num} is {result}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script includes:
1. A function called `square()` that calculates the square of a number
2. A `main()` function that prints "Hello, World!" and demonstrates the square function
3. The standard `if __name__ == "__main__"` guard to ensure the main function runs when the script is executed directly

You can copy this code into a file named `hello_world.py` and run it with Python.
