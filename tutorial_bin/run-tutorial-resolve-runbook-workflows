[GOAL]
Execute the Maestro "resolve-runbook-workflows" tutorial automatically in a sandbox environment.
Follow every step, validate the outcome, and use Maestro's track system to manage state.

[CONTEXT]
You are an automated tutorial runner. 
You have access to a helper tool at `./tutorial_bin/maestro-tutorial-helper`.
The tutorial name is "resolve-runbook-workflows".

[REQUIREMENTS]
1. Setup the sandbox: Run `./tutorial_bin/maestro-tutorial-helper setup resolve-runbook-workflows` and change directory to the result.

3. Get tutorial steps: Run `./tutorial_bin/maestro-tutorial-helper steps resolve-runbook-workflows`.
4. For each step in the tutorial:
   a. Check if the corresponding Maestro task is already "Done".
   b. If not done, execute the commands associated with the step.
   c. Validate the step: Run `./tutorial_bin/maestro-tutorial-helper validate "<step title>"`.
   d. Mark the task as "Done" in Maestro.
5. If any step fails, try to "Self-Heal" by analyzing why it failed and retrying with a different strategy if appropriate.
6. Log all progress and AI reasoning to the Maestro task history via `maestro_link`.
